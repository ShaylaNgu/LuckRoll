reasons:
- for why testing previous name already tested(no.input 8), to make sure program checks new inputed name if it already exists.
- testing '4'is boundary case like '1', '4' is the last value on vector storing names
 


test characters, numbers(  decimals, negatives), special characters and spaces  
- all are bondary cases to make sure program works when user input unconvertional name 
defined previousNames = ["1.0", "ki-2", "$", "hi", "o o", "treeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"]; - for whitebox testing pursoses 
 - meaning program should continue to loop until anything but "1.0", "ki-2", "$", "hi", "o o"  or "treeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"
	is typed in
